			    <p>The Urban Displacement Project aims to understand the nature of gentrification and displacement. While the quantitative indicators provide empirical evidence about gentrification and displacement, the true impact of these problems are felt by people, not numbers. The Story Maps component of the project uses multimedia content such as short video clips, photos, infographics, and spoken work to document the stresses and resilience of communities in the face of gentrification and displacement.</p>
			    <p>This project draws conceptual and design inspiration from the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project's <a href="https://antievictionmappingproject.net/narratives.html" target="_blank">Narratives</a> map, which documents oral histories of displacement and resistance in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, and New York.</p>
			    <p>Spatial and statistical data sources for the project include:
			    	<ul>
			    		<li>Southern California Gentrified Neighborhoods layer from UCLA Neighborhood Change Database under the Urban Displacement Project</li>
			    		<li>Land Use data from SCAG GIS/Data services</li>
			    		<li>Neighborhood boundaries layer from the UCLA Building Healthy Communities initiative data repository</li>
			    	</ul>
			    <p>The project was made possible with funding from <a href="https://www.calendow.org/building-healthy-communities/" target="_blank">The California Endowment's Building Health Communities Initiative</a>, the <a href="https://knowledge.luskin.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA Center for Neighborhood Knowledge</a>, and the <a href="http://www.aasc.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" >UCLA Asian American Studies Center</a>.</p>

			   <p>The Boyle Heights Building Healthy Communities (BHC) neighborhood is located just east of Downtown Los Angeles. The neighborhood is bounded by Mission Rd. and Valley Blvd. to the north, East Washington Blvd to the south, and by the Los Angeles River and Sullivan St. to the west and east, respectively.
			   </p>
			   <p>Boyle Heights is home to about 91,000 residents, and is a predominantly Latino neighborhood.
				</p>
			   <img src="assets/bh-ethnoracial.png" />
			   <p>In 2015, the average household income in Boyle Heights was roughly $42,000, about only half of the county’s average. Boyle Heights is also majority renter. Of these renters, a majority pay 30% or more of their income toward rent (i.e. are under rent burden) and a third live under conditions of extreme rent burden (spending 50% or more of their income on rent). These figures, combined with increasing development in the area, means the community faces many pressures and displacement risks.

Boyle Heights has seen 173 major sites of activity, amounting to over $340 million. Although this accounts for just about 1% of LA City’s permits, major new development is occurring nearby and along the edges of the neighborhood, signaling the potential arrival of future development.</p>
